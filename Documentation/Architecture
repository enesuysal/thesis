-- Receiver 
 In receiver we define a set of predefined resource types.They are primitive types such as 
 integer, boolean, string, etc and compound resource and operation 
 (this is basically only the interface. The actual code is a method invoked by reflexion, given its name)


--Binary format

We need define binary format to which messages are serialized on send and recovered on reception. 
We started using an array of bytes with each resource serialized in a tag which is a byte codifying each resource type, size, 
name that only on structure and resource components and value which is the actual sequence of bytes resulting from serializing the 
resource.

-- Serializer

We define a set of classes implementing each type of resource, including serialization to the binary format and
recovery from that format (each resource knows how to produce its bytes and to recover from bytes with its tag). 
The tag permits to reconstruct completely a given resource that has been serialized


-- DOM - Document Object Model 

 Given a message received, you can reconstruct the corresponding resource (in effect, this corresponds to a DOM, 
 with parsing based on tags simplifying the reconstruction)
 
 Compliance checking (matching the message received and the argument) is done at the level of the programming language, by reflection (or you can define a method in a subclass of the operation class to do this) 

 Compound resources support traversal (return a link to one of its components, given its name)
 
 
 
 The idea would be to implement this in Java, then adapt it to C# (or vice-versa), so that two different languages can 
 use the SIL binary format and compliance philosophy. You can start by only basic stuff (just one or two primitive resources) and 
 then go up to where you can (there is no need to implement all this simplified SIL). The goal is basically to demonstrate the concept, not build a full system.
