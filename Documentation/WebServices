Web services allow you use two different machines or two different pieces of code that talk each other. Two different applications can talk to each other over the network. They can call methods of each other over the network by using web service technology. The other advantage of using web services is actually it is a standard technology because it is not really specific to java or any other language. You can write web services all other technologies. For example you can write web service with Java, .Net, Python, C++ or others. The best part of web service standard what is called as Interoperability that mean is a property of a product or system, whose interfaces are completely understood, to work with other products or systems, present or future, without any restricted access or implementation[**]. For example let’s say you have written web service in Java, let’s say you have another web service that written in .Net so what the web service technology allows you to do is Java can call .Net web service and .Net web service can also call Java web service and it just doesn’t have to be web service let’s say you have another application written in C++, so you can actually have C++ app that call java web service or .Net web service.
You can actually have different applications written in different technologies that communicate with each other during execution time and they can call each other. This actually let us do is you can actually pick and choose technologies that you want to use let’s say you have set of business web services that are implemented in .Net and your java application can use them.
