Hi, Enes,

 

You cannot use standard Java or C# object serialization, since you’ll run into the problem you mention. You should serialize non-primitive objects by reflection, as I mention in my last mail, which I repeat as an annex.

 

Also, note that the receiver does not reconstruct the message object serialized at the sender (contrary to what is done in DOM). Rather, compliance is done at the binary level, with primitive components, as I described in one of my last emails. Only the components that match are assigned to the formal argument of the operation.

 

This means that you also need to serialize component names, so that matching is possible at the binary level.

 

Can you meet me at Taguspark on Wednesday, 9th, sometime from 10h30 to 12h30?

 

Regards,

 

Delgado
